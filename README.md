# [BoostMyRevenue](http://www.boostmyrevenue.net)
*Share a percentage of your revenue among your users, grow your company!* 
*By simply logging their interactions.*

*If you want to distribute your revenues/earnings among your users according to their interactions and usage of your app, then this api does just that for you.*


***You can find a test implementation project [here](https://github.com/sayemkcn/bmr-test)*** <br/>
***For push notification tutorial [click here](https://github.com/sayemkcn/BoostMyRevenue/blob/master/firebasecm.md)***

<b> Add BoostMyRevenue to your project</b>

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
	
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.sayemkcn:BoostMyRevenue:v1.9.0'
}

```

<b>Register</b>


*You have to register our website to get client_id and client_secret for your app*

[Register Here](http://www.boostmyrevenue.net)

Click 'Show' button to copy your client id and secret.

<b>Initialize BoostMyRevenue</b>

```
    // On your MainActivity
    SMR.initialize(getApplicationContext(), "client_id", "client_secret");
```
<b>Get User info and set user</b>
```
    SMR.setUser(this, "John Doe"); // Will take the device primary email address to create account

    // Or, if users email address is verified by you, you can set it yourself
    // !IMPORTANT! Please remember to verify email address if you use this method. Otherwise your user can register with any email address. It's what you want to forbid,right?
    SMR.setUser(this, "John Doe", "example@example.com");

```

## Now you just have to log user interactions
<b> Before logging user interactions, be sure to take storage permission from user. We use storage to provide offline logging capabilities. </b>
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
You may need [runtime permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html#java) on android version higher than marshmallow.

<b>Create Events</b>

```
    EventFactory.getInstance().createEvent(Event.Type.USER_EVENT, "event_code", "event_tag", Event.Weight.NORMAL); // returns an event instance too.
```

You can create as much events as you want for future use. All of the events will be registered to <b>EventRegistry</b>.

You can find any specific event by tag or event code. (You should always get events from the registry instead of creating one every time)

```
    Event e = EventRegistry.getInstance().getEventByTag("event_tag");
```

<b>Log User Interactions</b>

```
    SMR.logOnline(MainActivity.this, e);
```


##<b>View for users to see earnings, send payment requests</b>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ITN8z5a.png" width="500" />

Just add this view anywhere you want. That's it.

```
       <xyz.rimon.smr.views.MyRevenueView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"

        app:backgroundColor="#797979"
        app:boxBackgroundColor="#676767"
        app:textColor="@android:color/white"
        app:title="Your App Name" />
```
